In this task, I used the pandas and json to parse data from an excel data sheet and make a json file of a specific format from it .I first saw the conversion from python to json and saw that lists come in square brackets and dictionaries in curly brackets . First, the date was in datetime format so i converted it to date and then specified the row index to create lists for breakfast , lunch and dinner .Then  I ran a for loop for it to run in every column, then I also included the code to remove the '********' from the menu in the for loop so that it is removed from every column .then i printed it and converted it to a json file
